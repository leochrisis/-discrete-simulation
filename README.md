I don't why will you want it, but if you want that are some things I have to tell you.

I'm running all those things in Ubuntu terminal, so, if you want to see results just install node.
Then go to teminal, enter in this repo and run node file-name.js, than you'll see the magic.
Or just go and create a node project on repl.it, paste all those codes in there and run.
